# SAMG55_oxyboard
\simple Board designed for the SAMG55 Atmel microprocessor

Board designed for the elective subject "Introduction to printed circuit Design" of the Electronic Engineering Degree on Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional Facultad Regional Buenos Aires (UTN-FRBA). 

The developed board was designed to have a SAMG55J19 Atmel Microcontroller, which will be capable of receiving the information by a I2C sensor, show the obtained information to the user (using a small LCD display) and be able to send it though a wireless communication, using a WiFi module, to a third-party or a database. This project does not have the sensor incorporated in it, it is on another board which is mounted under it.
The  Wi-Fi transceiver used was the RN1810E, from Microchip. It has a UART interface, and the module already has the antena integrated.  
It has a BQ21040 battery charger and a BU33SD5WG-TR regulator, since this will be a LiOn battery source board. The battery has to be charged through a MicroUSB.
